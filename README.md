Central API key vault plugin — consolidate keys scattered across `.env` files into one encrypted vault, register new keys without exposing them in chat, and propagate a single update to every project. While you tiki-taka with the AI, keys are looked up and wired in automatically.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/fivetaku/gptaku_plugins.git
```

### 2. Install

```
/plugin install tikeytaka
```

### 3. Restart Claude Code

(New commands only register after a restart.)

### 4. Run

```
/tikeytaka
```

Then run `bash <plugin-path>/bin/tkt init` once in your own terminal (the command tells you the exact path) and consolidate existing keys with `/tikeytaka:scan`.

## Why tikeytaka?

A real home-directory scan found **45 `.env` files**, with the same provider key present in 6 files under 3 different values — most of them dead. Scattered keys mean you can't rotate, can't revoke, and don't even know what you have. tikeytaka makes one encrypted file the source of truth and turns every `.env` into a machine-refreshed copy.

- **Zero sign-up**: auto-detects a cloud folder you already use (iCloud Drive / Google Drive / OneDrive / Dropbox) and syncs one encrypted file through it. Falls back to local single-device mode. The chosen path is pinned and never silently switches.
- **Safe by construction**: AES-256-CBC + PBKDF2 (600k iterations, SHA-256) with a built-in integrity hash (TKT2 format). A corrupted or half-synced vault is detected and the tool halts — it **never overwrites the original**, and keeps a `.bak` generation before every change.
- **OS integration**: the decryption passphrase lives in macOS Keychain / Linux secret-tool / Windows DPAPI. A 0600 file fallback exists only behind explicit opt-in (`TKT_ALLOW_FILE_FALLBACK=1`).
- **Minimal exposure**: key values enter only via hidden terminal prompt (`tkt setp`) or stdin (`set-stdin`) — never chat, shell history, or process argv.

## How it works

```
you / Claude  ──►  bin/tkt (single bash CLI)
                     ├── secrets.enc   encrypted vault, travels via your cloud folder
                     ├── OS keychain   holds the one passphrase, never leaves the device
                     └── map.tsv       device-local wiring: which .env gets which key
```

The cloud only ever carries ciphertext; the key to open it never leaves your devices. `tkt sync` decrypts once, verifies integrity, then refreshes every mapped `.env` while preserving file permissions.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/tikeytaka` | Status summary (key count, vault location, pending propagation) |
| `/tikeytaka:use` | **Check the vault first when a task needs an API key → wire and test automatically** (no asking) |
| `/tikeytaka:scan` | Discover existing project `.env` files → consolidate keys into the vault (with live-key validation) |
| `/tikeytaka:add` | Register a new key without chat exposure |
| `/tikeytaka:list` | Managed services and project connections |
| `/tikeytaka:sync` | Propagate the vault to every connected `.env` |

## Connecting a new device

1. Wait for the cloud folder to sync (the vault file arrives)
2. `bash <plugin-path>/bin/tkt init` — enter the same vault passphrase
3. Wire this device's projects: `/tikeytaka:scan` (or `tkt map-add`) — the mapping list is device-local by design
4. `tkt sync`

## Requirements

- `bash`, `openssl` (both ship with macOS, Linux, and Git for Windows — Claude Code's Windows shell)
- A secret store: macOS Keychain / Linux `secret-tool` / Windows PowerShell (DPAPI)

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS (Keychain + iCloud/others) | Verified |
| Windows (Git Bash + OneDrive/Google Drive + DPAPI) | Implemented, provisional |
| Linux (secret-tool + Dropbox, or manual `TIKEYTAKA_DIR`) | Implemented, provisional |

## Known limits (honest disclosure)

- **No concurrent editing**: simultaneous `set`/`del` from two devices makes one side halt on conflict detection (data stays safe). Single-user tool by design.
- macOS Keychain registration (`security -w`) passes the passphrase through process argv once during init — a tool limitation.
- This is a personal vault. For team sharing, access control, or audit logs, use a secrets SaaS (e.g. Infisical).
- No local vault protects an already-compromised account (keyloggers etc.).
